# VIEWS Conflict Forecast API - MVP

This is the MVP version of the VIEWS conflict forecasting API.  
It exposes 36 months of global raster forecasts (0.5Â° grid) via FastAPI.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd JunctionHack/fastapi_demo
```
### 2. Build Docker image
```bash
docker build -t views-mvp .
```
### 3. Run the API
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 views-mvp
```
The API will be available at http://localhost:8000.
### 4. Run tests
```bash
make test
```
### 5. Lint and type checks
```bash
make lint
mypy app/main.py
```
